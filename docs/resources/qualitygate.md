# sonarqube_qualitygate (Resource)

Provides a Sonarqube Quality Gate resource. This can be used to create and manage Sonarqube Quality Gates and their Conditions.


## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "sonarqube_qualitygate" "main" {
  name       = "example"
  is_default = true

  condition {
    metric    = "new_coverage"
    op        = "LT"
    threshold = "50"
  }

  condition {
    metric    = "vulnerabilities"
    threshold = "10"
    op        = "GT"
  }
}
```

**Disclaimer: Operator Requirement for Grade Rating Conditions**

When working with grade rating conditions, (A-D), it is important to note that the "GT" (greater than) operator must be used for the `op` field. This is due to SonarQube's API design. More information can be found in this [issue](https://github.com/jdamata/terraform-provider-sonarqube/issues/171).

For example, if you are using a grade rating metric such as `new_reliability_rating`, where A represents the highest rating and subsequent letters represent lower ratings, you need to supply the `op` field with "GT" via the provider. Using "LT" will return an error from SonarQube's API:

```terraform
    condition {
        metric    = "new_reliability_rating"
        op        = "GT"
        threshold = "1"
    }
```
